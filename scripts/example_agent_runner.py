This example shows how to define agents so that they can be systematically run
in a specific environment (important for agent evaluation purpuses)

Instructions to Run:
- Start KSP game application.
- Select Start Game > Play Missions > Community Created > pe1_i3 > Continue
- In kRPC dialog box click Add server. Select Show advanced settings and select Auto-accept new clients. Then select Start Server
- In a terminal, run this script
